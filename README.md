# Multi-Stage BJT Amplifier Design -- Integrating Common-Base, Common-Emitter, and Common-Collector Stages --


This project teaches how to build a complete, high-performance amplifier by connecting three different types of specialized circuits. The goal is to combine the strengths of each part and then use computer simulation to prove the final design works correctly
