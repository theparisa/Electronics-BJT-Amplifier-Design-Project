# Multi-Stage BJT Amplifier Design & Simulation

This project teaches how to build a complete, high-performance amplifier by connecting three different types of specialized circuits. The goal is to combine the strengths of each part and then use computer simulation to prove the final design works correctly

## key Features

* Cascades three distinct amplifier stages, each with an optimized role.
* Integrates **Common-Base**, **Common-Emitter**, and **Common-Collector** topologies.
* Covers a complete analysis of DC biasing, small-signal gain, and large-signal swing.
* Validates theoretical hand calculations against practical **PSpice** simulations.
* Requires **designing for specific targets**, like a set input impedance or maximized output.
